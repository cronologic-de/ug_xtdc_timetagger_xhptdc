\section{Auto Triggering Function Generator\label{cp:AutoTriggeringFunctionGenerator}}
Some applications require internal periodic or random triggering. The \deviceName\ function generator provides this functionality.\par

The delay between two trigger pulses of this trigger generator is the sum of two components: A fixed value M and a pseudo random value given by the exponent N. \par

The period is

\begin{align}
    T = 1 + M + [1...2^N]
\end{align}

clock cycles with a duration of $4 ns$ per cycle.\par

The trigger can be used as a source for the TiGer unit (see Section \ref{cp:tiger}).


\section{Timing Generator (TiGer)\label{cp:tiger}}
Each LEMO-00 input can be used as a LVCMOS trigger output. The TiGer function can be configured independently for each connector. 
Each TiGet block can use an arbitrary combination of inputs to trigger its state machine including the AutoTrigger.
See Section \ref{cp:tigerblock} for a full description of the configuration options.

Figure \ref{fig:matrix} shows how the TiGer blocks are connected. They can be triggered by an OR of an arbitrary combination of inputs, 
including the auto trigger. Each TiGer can drive its output to its corresponding LEMO connector. This turns the connector into an output. 

\ifxHPTDC{
	The TiGer outputs are AC coupled to the connector. They can be operated in one of the following modes:
	\paragraph*{\textsf{TIGER\tu OFF}} 
		No signal is output to the connetor. 
	\paragraph*{\textsf{TIGER\tu OUTPUT}} 
		In this mode the connector is input only. Pulses are unipolar with 2V amplitude. 
		Connected hardware must not drive any signals to connectors used as outputs, as doing so could damage both the \deviceName and the external hardware. 
		We recoomend to only use short pulses to avoid undesirable baseline shift due to the AC coupling, but the device does not pose any restrictions on the duty cycle. 
		This mode can be used as a clock output with a frequency of $75/N$~MHz for integer $N$.
	\paragraph*{\textsf{TIGER\tu BIDI}} 
		In this mode the TiGer creates unipolarpulses with 1V amplitude and still be used as an input. 
		Use short pulses to keep the propability of collision and the effect on the baseline low.	
	\paragraph*{\textsf{TIGER\tu BIPOLAR}} 
		In this mode the connector creates bipolar pulses with 1V amplitude. The connector can still be used as an input. 
		The pulses have no effect on the baseline offset. 
		TiGer should be configured with $stop = start$ for minimum width bipolar pulses of $2 \times 6.\overline{6}~ns$. 
		The maximum bipolar pulse width is \textsf{XHPTDC8\tu TIGER\tu MAX\tu BIPOLAR\tu PULSE\tu LENGTH = 15}.    
}{
	The TiGer is DC coupled to the connector. Connected hardware must not drive any signals to connectors used as outputs, 
	as doing so could damage both the \deviceName and the external hardware.
	Pulses that are short enough for the input AC coupling are available as input signals to the \deviceName. 
	This can be used to measure exact time differences between the generated output signals and input signals on other channels.

	\subsection{Triggering the ADC with the TiGer}
		\label{adctiger}
		There is a ninth TiGer hat is connected to the trigger input of the ADC. See section \ref{adc} for additional information on the ADC. 

		The ADC TiGer can be used with retrigger set to periodically sample ADC data. 
		The period should be no shorter than 300ns or 45 TiGer clocks.

		The ADC TiGer can also be used to sample voltages relative to one of the TDC inputs. In this case 
		stop should be set to at least 45 to ensure that the sample period criterion is met even when pulses
		arrive in quick succession.

	\section{Gating}
		Each TDC channel has a second TiGer block that functions as a gate as shown in figure \ref{fig:matrix}. 
		While that output of that gating block is active no hits are recorded in that channel.
		If the block is negated hits are only recorded while the gating block is active.
		
		This is a useful feature in setups where the trigger creates a lot of noise.
		A suitable configuration of the gating block can reduce the bandwidth an buffer usage significantly.
		The gating is performed before the L0 buffer. 
		
	\section{Triggerable ADC}
		\label{adc}
		The \deviceName is equipped with a Triggerable ADC. 
		Whenever there is a rising edge on the ADC trigger connector, 
		the voltage on the ADC input connector is sampled. 
		The result is inserted as a packet with timestamp and ADC value into the readout data stream.

		The ADC trigger also is connected to the output of a TiGer block. 
		This can be used to to trigger the ADC periodical or relative to one of the TDC inputs.

		The triggers should not be closer than 300ns apart.

		There two ADCs interleaved to ensure that there is always an ADC available. 
		This is exposed to the user both in the output data format and in the TiGer and Gating trigger sources.
		When using the ADC trigger as a trigger for Gating or TiGer both trigger sources shall be set to the same value.
		During readout the information which ADC a sample originated from can be ignored unless advanced calibration is 
		desired for the ADC data. In that case the two ADCs should be treated separately.
