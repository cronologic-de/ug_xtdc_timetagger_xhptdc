\section{Installing the Board}
The \deviceName\ board can be installed in any PCIe-CEM slot with x1 or more lanes. 
Make sure the PC is powered off and the main power connector is disconnected while installing the board.\par

\section{\deviceName\ Inputs and Connectors}
	Figure \ref{fig:bracket} shows the location of the inputs on the slot bracket.

	Lemo-00 connectors are used for input connection. The inputs are AC-coupled and have an impedance of 50$\Omega$. 
	A schematic of the input circuit is shown in Figure \ref{fig:inputcirc}. 
	The digital threshold for any input can be adjusted to comply with a multitude of single ended signaling standards.
	The threshold can also be used to configure the input for either positive or negative pulses.
	
	
	The connectors can also be used as outputs. 
	\ifxHPTDC{AC-coupled}{DC-coupled} output pulses for automatic internal triggering and control of external devices 
	can be generated using the TiGer timing pattern generator. See section \ref{cp:tiger} for details on TiGer.

	Connector J25 is reserved for future use. The pinout of connector J12 is shown in Table \ref{J12} and the pinout of connector J6 is depicted in Table \ref{J6}.

	\section{Synchronizing multiple boards}
		\label{multiboard}
		If more than eight TDC inputs are required, up to eight boards can be synchronises within a system. 
		
		The \deviceName\ API described in chapter \ref{cp:api} manages up to eight boards automatically
		and provides a single data stream that contains sorted hit data from all boards in chronological order. 
		Channel A of each board is assigned channel number \textsf{board\tu index} $\cdot 10$. 
		The \textsf{board\tu index} is assigned to the boards in the order of the serial numbers starting at 0.

		\subsection{Connecting multiple boards}
			The boards must each receive a common 10~MHz clock on connector J2. The connector is inside the PC enclosure. 
			Connectors J12 of all boards must be connected with a flat band cable with a terminator at each end. 
			Cable and Terminator are available from cronologic. See figure \ref{fig:multiboard} for a wiring example.

				\end{center} 
			\end{figure*}
			%
		\subsection{ClockBox}
			For systems of up to four boards cronologic offers the ClockBox product that conveniently makes four clock signals evailable 
			inside the PC enclosure. For use with the \deviceName, jumper JP3 of the CLockBox must be set as shown in Figure \ref{fig:clockbox} to set the clock frequency to 10~MHz.

					\caption{ClockBox jumper setting for 10~MHz.\label{fig:clockbox}}
				\end{center} 
			\end{figure*}
			%
		
		\subsection{Crates for multiple boards}
			Most PC mainboards don't have enough PCIe slots to support eight \deviceName s. 
			We offer external enclosure called "Ndigo Crate" that PCIe-over-cable technology to extend the number of available slots in a system.
			The extension is fully transparent to the host system. There are no additional drivers require. 
			Please see the \href{https://www.cronologic.de/products/pcie/pcie-crates}{product page} at our website \url{www.cronologic.de}.
