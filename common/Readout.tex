%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% run time control
\section{Run Time Control}
	\ttvar{int}{start\tu capture(}\device)\\
	Start data acquisition.\par

	\ttvar{int}{pause\tu capture(}\device)\\
	Pause a started data acquisition. 
	Pause and continue have less overhead than start and stop but don't allow for a configuration change.\par

	\ttvar{int}{continue\tu capture(}\device)\\
	Call this to resume data acquisition after a call to \textsf{\prefix pause\tu capture()}.
	Pause and continue have less overhead than start and stop but don't allow for a configuration change.\par

	\ttvar{int}{stop\tu capture(}\device)\\
	Stop data acquisition.\par

	\ttvar{int}{start\tu tiger(}\device)\\
	Start timing generator. This can be done independently of the state of the data acquisition.\par

	\ttvar{int}{stop\tu tiger(}\device)\\
	Stop timing generator. This can be done independently of the state of the data acquisition.\par

%%%%%% readout
\section{Readout}
	\ttvar{int}{acknowledge(}\device, \cronvar{crono\tu packet}{*packet)}\\
	Acknowledges the processing of the last read block. This is only necessary if \textsf{\prefix read()} is not called with 
	\textsf{in.acknowledge\tu last\tu read} set.\\
	This feature allows to either free up partial DMA space early if there will be no call to \textsf{\prefix read()} anytime soon. 
	It also allows to keep data over multiple calls to \textsf{\prefix read()} to avoid unnecessary copying of data. \par

	\ttvar{int}{read(}\device \cronvar{\prefix read\tu in}{*in,} \\ \cronvar{\prefix read\tu out}{*out)}\\
	Return a pointer to an array of captured data in \textsf{read\tu out}. 
	The result can contain any number of packets of type \textsf{\prefix packet}.
	\textsf{read\tu in} provides parameters to the driver. 
	A call to this method automatically allows the driver to reuse the memory returned in the previous call if \textsf{read\tu in.acknowledge\tu last\tu read} is set.\\
	Returns an error code as defined in the structure \textsf{\prefix read\tu out}.

	\subsection{Input Structure \prefix read\tu in}

		\ttvar{\prefix bool\tu t}{acknowledge\tu last\tu read}\\
		If set \textsf{\prefix read()} automatically acknowledges packets from the last read. 
		Otherwise \textsf{\prefix acknowledge()} needs to be called explicitely be the user. 

	\subsection{Input Structure \prefix read\tu out}
		\cronvar{crono\tu packet}{*first\tu packet}\\
		Pointer to the first packet that was captureed by the call of \textsf{\prefix read()}.\par

		\cronvar{crono\tu packet}{*last\tu packet}\\
		Address of header of the last packet in the buffer.\par

		\cronvar{int}{error\tu code}\\
		Assignments of the error codes.\par
		\begin{tabular}{lc}
			\crondef{CRONO\tu READ\tu OK} & 0\\
			\crondef{CRONO\tu READ\tu NO\tu DATA} & 1\\
			\crondef{CRONO\tu READ\tu INTERNAL\tu ERROR} & 2\\
			\crondef{CRONO\tu READ\tu TIMEOUT} & 3\par
		\end{tabular}\par

		\cronvar{const char}{*error\tu message}
		The last error in human readable form, possibly with additional information on the error.
