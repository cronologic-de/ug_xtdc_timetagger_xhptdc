\section{Status Information}
	

\subsection{Functions for Information Retrieval}
    The driver provides functions to retrieve detailed information on the board type, its configuration, settings and state. 
    The information is split according to its scope and the computational requirements to query the information from the board.
    
    \ifxHPTDC{
        The information is provided on a per board basis. The parameter \textsf{index} selects which board is queried.
