	\cronvar{unsigned char}{channel}\\
	Unused, always 0.\par

	\cronvar{unsigned char}{card}\\
	Identifies the source card in case there are multiple boards present. Defaults to 0 if no value is assigned to the parameter \textsf{board\tu id} in Structure \textsf{ndigo\tu init\tu parameters}.\par

	\cronvar{unsigned char}{type}\\
	The data stream consists of 32-bit unsigned data as signified by a value of 6.\par

	\cronvar{unsigned char}{flags}\\
	\indent\ttdef{ PACKET\tu FLAG\tu ODD\tu HITS} 1\\
	\indent The last data word in the data array consists of one timestamp only which is located in the lower 32 bits of the 64-bit data word (little endian).\par
	\indent\ttdef{ PACKET\tu FLAG\tu SLOW\tu SYNC} 2\\
	\indent Start pulse distance is larger than the extended timestamp counter range.\par
	\indent\ttdef{ PACKET\tu FLAG\tu START\tu MISSED} 4\\
	\indent The trigger unit has discarded packets due to a full FIFO.\par
	\indent\ttdef{ PACKET\tu FLAG\tu SHORTENED} 8\\
	\indent The trigger unit has shortened the current packet due to full FIFO.\par
	\indent\ttdef{ PACKET\tu FLAG\tu DMA\tu FIFO\tu FULL} 16\\
	\indent The internal DMA FIFO was full. Might or might not result in dropped packets.\par
	\indent\ttdef{ PACKET\tu FLAG\tu HOST\tu BUFFER\tu FULL} 32\\
	\indent The host buffer was full. Might or might not result in dropped packets.\par

	\cronvar{unsigned int}{length}\\
	Number of 64-bit elements (each containing up to 2 TDC hits) in the data array.\par

	\cronvar{unsigned \tu\tu int64}{timestamp}\\
	Coarse timestamp of the start pulse. Values are given in multiples of \itett{$500$~ps}{$5/3=1.\overline{6}$~ns}.\par

	\cronvar{unsigned \tu\tu int64}{data[1]}\\
	TDC hits. the user can cast the array to uint32* to directly operate on the TDC hits.

	The timestamp of the hit is stored in bits 31 down to 8 in multiples of 
	\itett{500~ps. For the -1G Variant bit 8 is always 0.}{
		$5/(3*128) = 13.0208\overline{3}$~ps
	}\\
	
	\label{flags}
	Bits 7 down to 4 are hit flags:\par
	\itett{
		Bit 7: Always 0.\par
		Bit 6: Always 1.\par
	} {
		Bit 7, 6: Resolution of this measurement. \ifxHPTDC{}{See section \ref{difficulthits}}.\\

		\begin{tabular}{|c|c||l|}
			\hline
			bit 7 & bit 6 & Measurement Type \\\hline\hline
			0 & 0 &  Normal full resolution measurement.\\\hline
			0 & 1 &  Measurement performed with carry chain TDC at about 150~ps resolution.\\\hline
			1 & 0 &  Full resolution measurement that might in the wrong place in the data stream.\\\hline
			1 & 1 &  Measurement with only $5/6~ns = 833.\overline{3}~ps$ resolution. \\\hline

	}
	Bit 5: Rollover. The time since start pulse exceeded the \itett{23}{24}-bit range that can be ecnoded in a data word. This word does not encode a measurement. 
	Instead the readout software should increment a rollover counter that can be used as the upper bits of consecutive time stamps.  
	The counters should be reset for each packet.
	The total offset of a hit in picoseconds can be computed by
	\[	\Delta T_{hit} = \mathrm{(\#\ rollovers \cdot 2^{\itett{23}{24}} + TDC\_ DATA_{hit}) \cdot \itett{timetagger4}{xtdc4}\_param\_info.binsize} \]
	\indent
	Bit 4: Set if this word encodes a rising edge. Otherwise, this word belongs to a falling edge.
	The channel number is given in the lowest nibble of the data word. A value of 0 corresponds to channel A, a value of 3 to channel D.\par
