Userguides for the xTDC4 and TimeTagger4 time to digital converters

This is a LaTeX2e project that creates the userguides for the [xTDC4](https://www.cronologic.de/products/tdcs/xtdc4-pcie) and [TimeTagger4](https://www.cronologic.de/products/tdcs/timetagger) time to digital converters by cronologic GmbH & Co. KG.
The interface of the two devices is almost identical. Therefore both user guides are created from the same source. Which user guide is created is controlled by the LaTeX macro `\deviceName`. It can be set to `xHPTDC8`, `xTDC4` or `TimeTagger4`. There are three top level files that control the configuration for the three users guides. 

To compile run
```shell
pdflatex xHPTDC8_User_Guide.tex
pdflatex xTDC4_User_Guide.tex
pdflatex TimeTagger4_User_Guide.tex

```
