The \deviceName\ is a \emph{common-start} high resolution time-to-digital converter. 
Timestamps of leading or trailing edges of digital pulses are recorded. 
The \deviceName\ produces a stream of output packets, each containing data from a single start event. 
The relative timestamps of all stop pulses that occur within a configurable range are grouped into one packet.

	\end{itemize} 


\section{Applications}
The \deviceName\ can be used in all time measurement applications where a common start setup with four channels is sufficient. 
For alternatives with more channels or more flexible grouping check our TDC website \href{https://www.cronologic.de/produkte/products-overview#tdcdata}{www.cronologic.de}.

The \deviceName\ is well suited for the following applications:
\begin{itemize}
	\item time of flight mass spectrometers (TOF-MS)
	\item LIDAR down to 2~mm resolution
	\item reciprocal counters
	\item coincidence measurements
	\item quantum communication
	\item time correleated single photon counting (TCSPC)
	\item synchronisation of atomic clocks
	\item fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM)
\end{itemize}
