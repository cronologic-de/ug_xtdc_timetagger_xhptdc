# VSCode LaTeX Workshop Recipes

`settings.json` contains four recipes with which you can compile the user guides using the [LaTeX Workshop Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

They use `lualatex` to compile either a single user guide (`TT4`, `xTDC4`, `xHPTDC8`) or all three user guides at once (`run all three`).
