The \deviceName\ is a \emph{common-start} low resolution high throughput time-to-digital converter. 
Timestamps of leading or trailing edges (or both) of digital pulses are recorded. 
The \deviceName\ produces a stream of output packets, each containing data from a single start event. 
The relative timestamps of all stop pulses that occur within a configurable range are grouped into one packet.

\section{Features}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 4-channel common start TDC
		\item Bin Size 500~ps (-2G) or 1~ns (-1G)
		\item Standard Range: 4.194~ms (23~bits)
		\item Extended Range: 1.073~s (31~bits)
		\item Bin size: 500~ps
		\item Double-pulse resolution: 1~ns (-2G) or 2~ns (1-G)
		\item Dead time between groups: none
		\item Minimum interval between starts: 4~ns
		\item L0 FIFO: 1000~words/channel
		\item L1 FIFO: 1000~words shared between channels
		\item PCIe~1.1~x1 with 200~MB/s throughput
	\end{itemize} 

\section{Applications}
	The \deviceName\  can be used in all time measurement applications where a common-start setup with 500~ps resolution is sufficient. 
	For alternatives with higher resolution, more channels or higher readout rates check our TDC website \href{https://www.cronologic.de/produkte/products-overview#tdcdata}{www.cronologic.de}.

	The \deviceName\ is well suited for the following applications:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item LIDAR down to 8~cm resolution
		\item blade oscillation measurements
		\item reciprocal counters
		\item coincidence measurements
		\item quantum key distribution (QKD)
		\item time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC)
	\end{itemize}
