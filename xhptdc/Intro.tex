The \deviceName\ is a streaming high-resolution time-to-digital converter. 
The time-of-arrival of leading or trailing edges of digital pulses are recorded in an infinite stream of timestamps.

A grouping mode is available that emulates common-start or common-stop behaviour. 

\section{Features}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 8-channel streaming TDC with 8~ps resolution
		\item Bin size: 13~ps
		\item Double-pulse resolution: 5~ns
		\item Dead time for readout: none
		\item L0 FIFO: 15~words/channel
		\item L1 FIFO: 512~words/channel
		\item L2 FIFO: 8000~words
		\item PCIe~1.1~x1 with 200~MB/s throughput
		\item auxiliary triggered ADC input
	\end{itemize} 
\section{Applications}
The \deviceName\ can be used in all time measurement applications with up to eight channels with a single board or up to 64 channels when synchronising eight boards. For applications wiht four channels or less that do not require the flexibility of a streaming TDC, simpler products are available on our website \href{https://www.cronologic.de/products/products-overview#tdcdata}{www.cronologic.de}.

The \deviceName\ is well suited for the following applications:
\begin{itemize}
	\item time of flight mass spectrometers (TOF-MS) with segmented detectors
	\item automated test equipment
	\item reciprocal counters
	\item coincidence measurements
	\item quantum communication
	\item time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC)
	\item synchronization of atomic clocks
	\item fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM)
\end{itemize}
