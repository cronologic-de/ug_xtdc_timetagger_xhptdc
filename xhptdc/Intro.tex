The \deviceName\ is a streaming high-resolution time-to-digital converter. 
The time-of-arrival of leading or trailing edges of digital pulses are
recorded in an infinite stream of timestamps.

A grouping mode is available that emulates common-start or common-stop
behavior. 

\section{Features}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 8-channel streaming TDC with 8~ps resolution
		\item Bin size: 13~ps
		\item Double-pulse resolution: 5~ns
		\item Dead time for readout: none
		\item L0 FIFO: 15~words/channel
		\item L1 FIFO: 512~words/channel
		\item L2 FIFO: 8000~words
		\item Synchronization of up to six boards.
		\item PCIe~1.1~x1 with 200~MB/s throughput
		\item Auxiliary triggered ADC input
	\end{itemize} 
\section{Applications}
The \deviceName\ can be used in all time measurement applications with up to
eight channels with a single board or up to 48 channels when synchronizing
six boards. For applications with four or fewer channels that do not require
the flexibility of a streaming TDC, simpler products are available on our
website \href{https://www.cronologic.de/products/products-overview#tdcdata}{%
www.cronologic.de}.

The \deviceName\ is well suited for the following applications:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometers (TOF-MS) with segmented detectors
	\item Automated test equipment
	\item Coincidence measurements
	\item Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)
	\item Time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC)
	\item Synchronization of atomic clocks
	\item Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM)
\end{itemize}
