The \deviceName\ is a streaming high resolution time-to-digital converter. 
The time-of-arrival of leading or trailing edges of digital pulses are recorded in an infinite stream of timestamps.

A grouping mode is available that emulates common-start or commont-stop behaviour.

\section{Applications}
The \deviceName\ can be used in all time measurement applications that either require more than four channels or the flexibility of a streaming TDC.

The \deviceName\ is well suited for the following applications:
\begin{itemize}
	\item time of flight mass spectrometers (TOF-MS) with segmented detectors
	\item automated test equipment
	\item reciprocal counters
	\item coincidence measurements
	\item quantum communication
	\item time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC)
	\item synchronization of atomic clocks
	\item fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM)
\end{itemize}
