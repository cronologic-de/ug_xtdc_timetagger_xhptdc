The \deviceName\ is a \emph{common-start} high resolution time-to-digital
converter.  Timestamps of leading or trailing edges of digital pulses are
recorded.  The \deviceName\ produces a stream of output packets, each
containing data from a single start event.  The relative timestamps of all
stop pulses that occur within a configurable range are grouped into one packet.

\section{Features}

\section{Applications}
The \deviceName\ can be used in all time measurement applications where a
common start setup with four channels is sufficient.  For alternatives with
more channels or more flexible grouping check our TDC website
\href{https://www.cronologic.de/produkte/products-overview#tdcdata}{www.cronologic.de}.

The \deviceName\ is well suited for the following applications:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometers (TOF-MS)
	\item LIDAR down to \SI{2}{\milli\meter} resolution
	\item Reciprocal counters
	\item Coincidence measurements
	\item Quantum communication
	\item Time-Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC)
	\item Synchronization of atomic clocks
	\item Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM)
\end{itemize}
